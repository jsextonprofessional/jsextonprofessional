# Hi I'm Jacob Sexton. 🤠

## I'm a Software Engineer located on planet Earth. 🌎
> The Lion's Share of my professional experience has been spent working as a Full Stack Engineer in the FinTech/Fundraising space for Snap! Mobile, building products such as their transaction checkout funnel used to raise over $1B (Billion with a 🅱️) in donations for schools and sports teams (2021-2024).
> Prior to my time at Snap!, I consulted for VisionQuest Collective as a Frontend Engineer on projects for Dallas-based businesses and nonprofits - including Murl Bakes, Pilot Peer Assist, Bangkok Inn, Owlift (formerly ELI 5), and Katharos Fire (2018-2021).
> Most recently, I have gone independent, contracting for Frisco Web Agency, Shaddock Homes, and SummitTX Capital on a variety of projects spanning Software Engineering, UI/UX, and Design.
