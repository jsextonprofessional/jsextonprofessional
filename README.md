# Hi I'm Jacob Sexton. ü§†

## I'm a Software Engineer located on planet Earth. üåé
- The Lion's Share of my professional experience has been spent working as a Full Stack Engineer in the FinTech/Fundraising space for Snap! Mobile, building products such as their transaction checkout funnel used to raise over $1B (Billion with a üÖ±Ô∏è) in donations for schools and sports teams. (2021-2024)
- Prior to my time at Snap!, I consulted for VisionQuest Collective as a Frontend Engineer on projects for Dallas-based businesses and nonprofits - including Murl Bakes, Pilot Peer Assist, Bangkok Inn, Owlift (formerly ELI 5), and Katharos Fire. (2018-2021)
- Most recently, I have gone independent, contracting for Frisco Web Agency, Shaddock Homes, and SummitTX Capital on a variety of projects spanning Software Engineering, UI/UX, and Design. (2025)

## Tech + Tools
- **_Typescript_** - My strongsuit is Typescript in all of its glory - React, Next.js, Node.js, Vue.js. I've certainly spent the most hours building with TS and have grown to prefer it over the past 3 years.
- **_Ruby on Rails_** - Rails helped me realize how to have fun with code, and about the power of high level tooling - Hotwire, Turbo, Devise, Stimulus. I love how Rails allows for scaffolding out the building blocks of production ready applications in no time.
- **_Python_** - My first love is Python with Django and/or Flask. Python is the what I was working with when coding `*clicked*` for me.
- **_CoPilot_** - CoPilot is like wearing rocket boosters üöÄ. It 10x's my coding speed and in turn allows me to scale problem solving to the next orders of magnitude.
